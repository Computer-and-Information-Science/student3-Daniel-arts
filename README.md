Create a **student** class in java. 
The student should have 3 data members:
* String name
* int id
* double gpa

  It should have one constructor, that takes in all three pieces of data, and assigns them using the **this** operator;

  Each data member should have a corresponding *getter* that allows another program to **get** information about the student, and a *setter* that allows someone to **set**  information for the student.

  It should also have a method called dispayStudent() which will output information about the student in this way:
  The student Bob Moore has an id of 87678 with a gpa of 3.5.

  In the main() method, create a **student** object  with the name "Lisa Waddell", id of 54321, and gpa of 2.5, then call the displayStudent() method to generate the ouput

  The student Lisa Waddell has an id of 54321 with a gpa of 2.5.
